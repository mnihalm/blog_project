Sometimes, the best way to understand your own thoughts is to write them down.
Sometimes, you forget to write them.
Sometimes, it feels like there's too much to write with very little to gain. 
Sometimes, there is too much that needs to fall into place before you can start writing. 
Sometimes, you remember that rationalization is easy for a master procrastinator and you end up writing anyway. 

This site is a product of that thought process. It hopes to bring clarity to other thoughts and processes.
