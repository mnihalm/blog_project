Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nihal.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. 

I'm currently working on drones and solutions at [Skylark Drones](skylarkdrones.com). Drones are damn cool and will be everywhere in the future from delivering pizzas to moving you around the city. If you want to hear more about how exactly that might happen, I have a newsletter that's got you covered [here](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/propwash/). Consider subscribing- I won't spam, and people say it's quite good. 

When I'm not working, I'm organizing the LessWrong/Slate Star Codex (SSC/ACX) meetups in [Bangalore](https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/i5vLw9xnG9iwXNQZZ). 

I'm interested in Drones, Technology, Open source and backyard astronomy. 

I read a lot, gaze at stars a lot more, and write much less than I should.
