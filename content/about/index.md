Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nihal.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. 

I'm currently working on drones and solutions at [Skylark Drones](skylarkdrones.com). I think that drones are damn cool and will shape our future. If you wanna hear more about how exactly that might happen, I have a newsletter that's got you covered [here](https://propwash.substack.com/). Consider subscribing- I won't spam, and people say it's quite good. 

When I'm not working, I'm organizing the LessWrong/SSC(ACX) meetups in [Bangalore](https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/i5vLw9xnG9iwXNQZZ). 

I'm interested in Drones, Technology, Open source, Silicon valley culture, startups, and business. 

I read a lot, gaze at stars a lot, and write (sometimes).
