I have a newsletter now! It's called Propwash, and you can find it [here](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/propwash/). 

## What's It about ? 
Propwash is the place where I write about the Drone industry, and share the most important developments happening in the space. It contains all the relevant industry news, company breakdowns, trends and market research, and content to keep you up to date and on the edge of the latest developments in the drone space. 

## will I be spammed? 
Of course not! I will grace your inbox only once a week for the weekly update. 

## Where can I find it? 
You can find it [here](https://propwash.nihalmohan.com). You can find all past and future issues there. Thanks to [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/) for making it very easy to start this project! You can subscribe to the newsletter below.
