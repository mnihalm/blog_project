I have a newsletter now! It's called Propwash, and you can find it [here](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/propwash/). 

## What's It about ? 
Propwash is the place where I write about the Drone industry, and share the most important developments happening in the space. It contains all the relevant industry news, company breakdowns, trends and market research, and content to keep you up to date and on the edge of the latest developments in the drone space. 

## Where can I find it? 
You can find it [here](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/propwash/).
I'm using Revue as my publishing platform, and would probably move it to a custom domain in the future.
