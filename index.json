Drones are damn cool and will be everywhere in the future from delivering pizzas to moving you aroung the city. If you want to hear more about how exactly that might happen, I have a newsletter that\u0026rsquo;s got you covered here. Consider subscribing- I won\u0026rsquo;t spam, and people say it\u0026rsquo;s quite good.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not working, I\u0026rsquo;m organizing the LessWrong/Slate Star Codex (SSC/ACX) meetups in Bangalore.\nI\u0026rsquo;m interested in Drones, Technology, Open source and backyard astronomy.\nI read a lot, gaze at stars a lot more, and write much less than I should.\n","ref":"/about/"}]
